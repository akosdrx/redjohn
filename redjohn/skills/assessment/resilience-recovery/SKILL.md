# RedJohn — resilience-recovery

## Purpose and activation
Analyzes exceptional recovery cases while program code handles routine recovery.

Before activation, `AssessmentSkillRegistry.eligibility` checks the target domain,
impact profile, actor/fixture prerequisites and actual capability registry.
This document does not run tools; execution uses the RedJohn controller, scheduler and policy.

## Prerequisites and context
NormalizedError, job/attempt reference, partial evidence, deadline and remaining retry budget.

Bind every action to `engagement_id`, `policy_revision`, `actor_ref`, `tenant_id`,
`session_revision`, `workflow_state` and `request_ref`/`asset_ref`. Use the explicit
`anonymous` actor for anonymous access; never substitute another identity for a missing actor.
Authentication/authorization comparisons require separate actors/tenants and test objects with known ownership.
State-changing workflows require designated disposable fixtures and verifiable cleanup.

## Supported input and body formats
Input mode: `metadata`. Formats supported by the manifest: no active request-body support.
Unsupported: any format not declared by the capability. Observed body metadata does not prove active replay support;
JSONL scanner output does not imply JSON request-body support. Preserve raw requests,
repeated parameters, query ordering and encoding in evidence references. The adapter's
input validation is authoritative; an unknown format is `unsupported`, not a negative test.

## Canonical capability and RedJohn mapping
No scanner adapter; internal module: redjohn.assessment.recovery, redjohn.assessment.scheduler.

Optional capability: none.
Unimplemented prerequisite: see the capability registry for current dependency/health status.
Declared status: `implemented_fixture_tested`. Runtime health reports missing
binaries/dependencies separately; loading a `SKILL.md` does not establish execution coverage.
Legacy dotted tool names are neither MCP nor shell calls and are not registered as tools.

## Impact profile and execution limits
Applicable target domain: web; profiles: safe-production, active-staging, isolated-lab.
Original maximum required impact profile: `safe-production`; the actual policy may be stricter.
Discovery alone cannot authorize new targets, accounts, regions or scope expansion.
ResourceEnvelope and the shared governor bound workers, browsers, pages, contexts and caches.
Each job has a finite timeout (default 30 s, validated ceiling 600 s), with campaign deadlines
and request, queue and artifact quotas. Optional engines do not start together.

## Procedure and control measurements
1. Check the prerequisites above and the manifest eligibility result.
2. Follow the FailureRecoverySystem plan; reconcile uncertain outcomes first and allow only a small number of probes in the circuit half-open state.
3. Preserve the control, result and coverage gap.

Record baseline/positive fixtures separately from fixed or rejecting controls.
A missing control is `not_run`/`inconclusive`; never invent a completed measurement.
Routine inventory, routing and parsing target zero internal LLM calls; provide only references
and a short coverage delta to the model.

## Result criteria and evidence
- Job/attempt and evidence references.
- Expected/observed result and remaining coverage gap.

Require expected and observed behavior, actor/workflow context, controls, evidence references,
tool/template versions and reproducibility. Matching a CVE to a product establishes applicability,
not a dynamic finding. A scanner message, a single HTTP 500 or timing difference, a callback,
or agreement between two agents is not independent proof and does not automatically establish RCE impact.

## Three separate status dimensions
`execution_status`: queued, running, retry_wait, succeeded, failed, cancelled,
timed_out, resource_exhausted. `coverage_status`: not_tested, completed, partial,
blocked, unsupported, inconclusive. `finding_status`: candidate, confirmed_weakness,
confirmed_impact, false_positive, fixed, reopened. An empty result from a valid, actually executed
test supports at most `no_finding_observed`; there is no global "safe" status.
The legacy pack's combined `passed`/`confirmed` enum is not part of the RedJohn schema.

## Timeout, stop, cleanup and recovery
Policy denial, missing prerequisites, unexpected side effects, storage failure or budget
exhaustion stop the affected work. Propagate cancellation; release subprocesses, pages,
contexts, listeners and leases in `finally`, and audit cleanup failures. Retry only safe,
idempotent work within shared attempt, retry and deadline budgets. Reconcile uncertain
side effects after a crash before proceeding. Refresh sessions for the same actor with a new
session revision and cache invalidation. Share cooldown after 429/Retry-After; classify 403
as a separate authorization/challenge outcome. Fallback must preserve authentication,
TLS verification, the Chrome sandbox and the engagement scope.

## False positives and coverage limits
Never retry indefinitely or fall back by weakening authentication, TLS verification or scope.

An unimplemented or blocked capability remains a coverage gap; its absence is not a negative
vulnerability test. Without a real control fixture for this subtask, record the measurement as
`not_run_missing_fixture` and the original RCE as `not_reproduced_missing_fixture`.

## Version, provenance and test references
RedJohn contract version: `2.0.0`; manifest schema: `1`.
RedJohn-native description based on master prompt 2.0. No external Strix/HexStrike source code was copied.

Contract/integration references: tests/test_assessment_resource_control.py.
Registry tests verify wiring; they do not establish positive/fixed detection controls for every
vulnerability family. A missing engine's control is `not_run_adapter_not_implemented`.
External background: OWASP WSTG/ASVS; record the specific edition in each assessment.
